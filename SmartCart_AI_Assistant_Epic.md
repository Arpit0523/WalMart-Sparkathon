## 🧠 Problem Statement

Shoppers, especially those in budget-sensitive or sustainability-conscious segments, often struggle to:
- Stay within budget while purchasing essentials
- Identify eco-friendly or health-conscious alternatives
- Get real-time, personalized guidance during shopping

Despite Walmart's everyday low price (EDLP) model and sustainability efforts, customers don't always get actionable insights while building their cart.

## 💡 Solution Overview

A smart, voice/chat-enabled AI assistant integrated into the Walmart app or website that:
- Recommends cheaper/sustainable/healthier alternatives in real-time while adding items to the cart
- Tracks live cart total and budget threshold with alerts
- Provides a "Green Score" or "Wellness Score" for each cart based on carbon, nutrition, or sourcing data
- Uses past purchase patterns and user preferences to personalize suggestions

## 🎯 Business Impact

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Reduce overspending and improve shopping experience
- **Sustainability Goals**: Drive eco-friendly purchases through intelligent nudging
- **Brand Positioning**: Position Walmart as tech-first, value-driven, and eco-responsible retailer
- **Revenue**: Increase customer retention and average order value through personalized recommendations
